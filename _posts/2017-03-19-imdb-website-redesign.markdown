After stumbling upon so many IMDb redesign concepts I was inspired to create one myself. The challenge was to create a concept that was efficient at showcasing the titles, making it easy for users to find out about a particular title and also for wandering users looking for inspiration.

## Movie cards
Quick look movie cards were designed to show key information about each movie including the genre, rating and a short synopsis.

## Icon glyphs
The icon glyphs across the website needed to be consistent so I created a set of icons to accompany various elements of the website.
