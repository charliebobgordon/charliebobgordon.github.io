We needed a cohesive visual language to represent various areas of the agency for use in printed collateral, presentations and on the web. I created a range of icon glyphs that could be expanded in the future.

## Grid system
Similar to how Apple created a grid system for iOS app icons in the iOS Human Interface Guidelines I created a custom grid system to control the layout and stroke weight of each glyph.

## The four pillars
The four pillars represent the key services of the agency. Online marketing, design, development and digital consultancy.

## Staff benefits
Glyphs to represent staff benefits were created including the cycle to work scheme, fresh fruit, gym membership and the beer fridge.
